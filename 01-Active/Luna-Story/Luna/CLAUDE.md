## Project Overview

This is a creative writing project for a German fantasy story called "Luna-Story". The repository contains story chapters, character descriptions, and spell-check results for a narrative about Luna, a small blue star who crash-lands on Earth and befriends Martin Kurkuma.

## File Naming Conventions

- **Character files**: `Character Name.md` in `Figuren/` directory
- **Scene files**: `N-Szene_M.md` where N is scene number (0-indexed) and M is scene number (1-indexed)
- **Spell-check files**: `Rechtschreibpruefung_Ergebnisse.txt` (German for "Spell-check Results")

## Content Structure

### Character Files
Each character file in `Figuren/` contains bullet-pointed personality traits, physical descriptions, and key characteristics written in German.

### Scene Files
Scene files contain narrative prose written in German, featuring:
- First-person narrator perspective with meta-commentary
- Character dialogue and descriptions
- Fantasy elements (stars, golems, dwarfs, feen/fairies)
- Internal cross-references using `[[Character Name]]` syntax (Obsidian wiki-links)

### Story Elements
- **Setting**: Modern Earth with fantasy elements
- **Main Characters**: Luna (crashed star), Martin Kurkuma (human), Heidelbeer (dwarf), Hinkbein (golem)
- **Themes**: Friendship, displacement, help from strangers
- **Language**: German prose with literary style

## Working with This Project

### Editing Story Content
- Maintain the established German literary voice and style
- Preserve existing character personalities and relationships
- Keep the whimsical, meta-narrative commentary style
- Use Obsidian-style `[[Character Name]]` links for character references

### Character Development
- Character traits are documented in individual files in `Figuren/`
- Luna: Blue star, changes color with mood, direct and sometimes rude, homesick
- Martin: Human, vinyl record collector, polite but awkward, lives in desert hut

### Scene Organization
- Each chapter (Kapitel) contains multiple scenes (Szenen)
- Scenes are numbered starting from 0
- New scenes should follow the existing naming pattern
- Consider the narrative flow when adding or editing scenes

## Language and Style Notes

- **Writing Style**: Literary fiction with fantasy elements
- **Perspective**: First-person narrator with meta-commentary
- **Tone**: Whimsical, thoughtful, occasionally humorous

## Quality Assurance

- Spell-check results are tracked in `Rechtschreibpruefung_Ergebnisse.txt`
- Review character consistency before major edits
- Maintain narrative continuity across chapters
- Preserve the unique voice and meta-narrative style
