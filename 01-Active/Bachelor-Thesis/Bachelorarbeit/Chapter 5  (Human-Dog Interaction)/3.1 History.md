For thousands of years, dogs have been companions to humans. Some of the oldest archaeological findings suggesting interaction between homini and canids date back to the early Upper Paleolithic, such as the skeleton found in a human burial zone in Předmostí, Czech Republic (Germonpré et. al.). Though highly disputed among researchers, initial domestication  likely began 11000 - 16000 years ago (Freedman et al.). 

It is safe to say that dogs have been companions to humans for a very long time, and not only for practical purposes. For example, researchers have identified oral cavity lesions on the famous Bonn-Oberkassel dog remains, indicating an infection with the Canine distemper virus. Canine distemper, a disease with a high mortality rate and common among puppies, has a disease course spanning three weeks. However, hypoplasia lines on the dog's remains however suggest that the young dog was seriously ill for nine weeks, during and before which it would not have been fit for utilitarian use. Given the severe nature of canine distemper, the dog's survival throughout these nine weeks would have likely required intensive human care, indicating an emotional bond between the puppy Late Pleistocene humans (Janssens et. al.).
