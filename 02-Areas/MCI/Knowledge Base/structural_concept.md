# MyMCI Knowledge Base - Structural Concept

## Overview

This document outlines the structural concept for the MyMCI knowledge base, following best practices from industry leaders like Airbnb, Spotify, and WhatsApp. The structure prioritizes **user intent** and **common tasks** over technical features, making it intuitive for users to find help when they need it.

## Core Principles

### 1. Task-Oriented Organization
- Structure content around what users want to **accomplish**, not what features exist
- Use action-oriented language that matches user thinking patterns
- Group related tasks together regardless of technical implementation

### 2. Progressive Disclosure
- Start with the most common scenarios
- Provide increasing detail as users dive deeper
- Keep initial options limited to avoid overwhelming users

### 3. Role-Based Personalization
- Tailor content visibility based on user role (Student, Staff, Referent)
- Provide role-specific entry points where needed
- Maintain consistent navigation patterns across roles

### 4. Search-First Design
- Optimize all content for search
- Use synonyms and common terms users might search for
- Include troubleshooting keywords in relevant articles

## Search Optimization Strategy

### Keyword Mapping
Each article should include:
- Primary keywords (exact feature names)
- Secondary keywords (common user terms)
- Problem-based keywords (error messages, issues)
- Synonym variations

### Example Keyword Mapping:
**Article**: "View and understand your grades"
- Primary: grades, marks, results, scores
- Secondary: academic performance, assessment, examination
- Problems: missing grades, wrong grade, grade not showing
- Synonyms: Noten, Bewertung, Leistung (German terms)

## Content Governance

### Update Frequency
- **Critical**: Within 24 hours (login issues, system outages)
- **High**: Within 1 week (new features, policy changes)
- **Medium**: Within 1 month (minor updates, clarifications)
- **Low**: Quarterly review (evergreen content)

### Ownership Matrix
| Category | Primary Owner | Reviewer | Update Cycle |
|----------|--------------|----------|--------------|
| Getting Started | IT Support | Student Services | Quarterly |
| Studies | Academic Affairs | Registrar | Semester |
| Mobility | International Office | Student Services | Monthly |
| Documents | Registrar | IT Support | Monthly |
| Technical | IT Support | Development Team | As needed |

## Conclusion

This structural concept prioritizes user needs over system architecture, making the MyMCI knowledge base intuitive and helpful. By organizing content around what users want to accomplish rather than how the system works, we create a more accessible and effective support resource.

The proposed structure scales well as new features are added and can adapt to changing user needs through regular analysis and optimization.
