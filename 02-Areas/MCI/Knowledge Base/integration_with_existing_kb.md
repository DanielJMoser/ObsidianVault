# Integration Strategy: MyMCI App KB with Existing MCI IT Knowledge Base

## Current State Analysis

### Existing MCI IT Knowledge Base
**URL**: https://services.mci.edu/en/it-services/knowledge-base-en

#### Strengths
- **Comprehensive IT coverage**: WiFi, email, software, security
- **Clear Q&A format**: Direct questions with detailed answers
- **Visual documentation**: Screenshots and step-by-step guides
- **Multilingual**: Available in English and German
- **Well-established**: Users already familiar with the structure

#### Current Categories
1. Account Management (passwords, MCI account)
2. IT Services (general IT support)
3. Email Services (configuration, access)
4. Software & Tools (licensing, installation)
5. Network & WiFi (connection guides)
6. Security Awareness (phishing, data protection)
7. Communication Platforms (Matrix Chat, BigBlueButton)

### Gap Analysis
The existing KB covers **IT infrastructure** but lacks:
- MyMCI app-specific features
- Academic processes (grades, evaluations, curriculum)
- Student services (Erasmus, internships, documents)
- Mobile app functionality
- Role-specific guidance (student vs staff workflows)

## Integration Approach

### Option 1: **Unified Knowledge Base** (Recommended)
Merge both knowledge bases under one roof with clear navigation.

```
MCI Knowledge Base
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üñ•Ô∏è IT & Technical Support (existing)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Account & Access
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Email & Communication
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Software & Tools
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Network & Security
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üì± MyMCI App (new)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Getting Started
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Academic Features
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Student Services
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Staff Resources
‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üîç Search All Topics
```

### Option 2: **Federated Approach with Cross-Linking**
Keep separate but heavily cross-linked knowledge bases.

**Pros**:
- Maintains existing IT KB structure
- Allows specialized ownership
- Easier initial implementation

**Cons**:
- Users need to know which KB to search
- Potential duplication of content
- More complex maintenance

## Recommended Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Establish MyMCI App KB Section
Create the MyMCI knowledge base as a new major section within the existing structure:

```markdown
# MCI Knowledge Base Home

## Choose Your Topic Area

### üñ•Ô∏è [IT Services & Technical Support](./it-services)
Need help with WiFi, email, passwords, or software?

### üì± [MyMCI App Support](./mymci-app)
Questions about grades, courses, Erasmus, or app features?

### üéì [Academic Systems](./academic-systems)
Help with Sakai, online learning, or academic tools?

### üîç [Search Everything](./search)
Not sure where to look? Search across all topics.
```

### Phase 2: Create Connection Points

#### Cross-Referenced Articles
```markdown
# How to Reset Your Password

## For MCI Account (Email, WiFi, etc.)
[Existing IT KB content]

## For MyMCI App
See: [MyMCI App Login Issues](../mymci-app/troubleshooting/login-issues)

## Related Articles
- [First Time MyMCI Setup](../mymci-app/getting-started/first-setup)
- [Two-Factor Authentication](./security/2fa-setup)
```

#### Unified Search Index
- Implement Algolia or ElasticSearch
- Index both KB sections
- Surface relevant results regardless of source

### Phase 3: Content Alignment

#### Adopt IT KB's Successful Patterns
1. **Question-First Headlines**
   - Current: "Email Configuration"
   - Better: "How do I set up my MCI email on my phone?"

2. **Consistent Article Structure**
   ```markdown
   # [Question as Title]

   ## Quick Answer
   [1-2 sentence summary]

   ## Detailed Steps
   [Platform-specific instructions]

   ## Troubleshooting
   [Common issues and solutions]

   ## Still Need Help?
   - IT Issues: itsupport@mci.edu
   - MyMCI App: mymci-support@mci.edu
   ```

3. **Visual Standards**
   - Use existing screenshot annotation style
   - Maintain consistent color coding
   - Apply same image sizing guidelines

### Phase 4: Governance Model

#### Ownership Matrix
| Area | Primary Owner | Backup | Review Cycle |
|------|--------------|--------|--------------|
| IT Services | IT Department | Help Desk | Quarterly |
| MyMCI App - Technical | IT Department | Dev Team | Monthly |
| MyMCI App - Academic | Academic Affairs | Student Services | Semester |
| MyMCI App - Mobility | International Office | Student Services | Monthly |

#### Content Synchronization Points
1. **Login/Authentication**: Shared between IT and MyMCI
2. **Account Management**: Single source of truth in IT KB
3. **Mobile Device Setup**: Combined IT + MyMCI guidance
4. **Troubleshooting**: Escalation from MyMCI to IT when needed

## Migration Strategy

### Week 1-2: Setup
- [ ] Create MyMCI section in existing KB platform
- [ ] Establish URL structure: `/kb/mymci/*`
- [ ] Set up redirects from any existing MyMCI help pages
- [ ] Configure analytics tracking

### Week 3-4: Core Content
- [ ] Migrate top 20 MyMCI articles
- [ ] Create cross-links from IT KB
- [ ] Add MyMCI section to main navigation
- [ ] Update search configuration

### Week 5-6: Enhancement
- [ ] Add interactive tutorials for complex processes
- [ ] Implement platform-specific content blocks
- [ ] Create role-based navigation paths
- [ ] Set up A/B testing for navigation approaches

### Week 7-8: Launch
- [ ] Soft launch to pilot group
- [ ] Gather feedback and iterate
- [ ] Train support staff on new structure
- [ ] Full launch with announcement

## Success Metrics

### Unified Metrics Dashboard
Track both KB sections together:
- Overall search success rate
- Cross-KB navigation patterns
- Time to resolution by topic area
- Support ticket deflection rate

### MyMCI-Specific KPIs
- App feature adoption after KB article views
- Mobile vs desktop usage patterns
- Role-based content effectiveness
- Process completion rates (Erasmus, onboarding)

## Content Examples

### Bridging Article Example
```markdown
# How do I access my courses and grades?

## Quick Answer
Course materials are in Sakai, while grades are viewed in the MyMCI app.

## Detailed Guide

### For Course Materials (Sakai)
1. Visit [sakai.mci.edu](https://sakai.mci.edu)
2. Log in with your MCI credentials
‚Üí [Full Sakai guide](../it-services/sakai-access)

### For Grades (MyMCI App)
1. Open the MyMCI app
2. Navigate to Grades section
‚Üí [View your grades](../mymci-app/academics/view-grades)

## Platform Notes
üì± **Mobile**: Both Sakai and MyMCI have mobile apps
üíª **Desktop**: Access both through web browsers

```

## Conclusion

By integrating the MyMCI app knowledge base with the existing IT knowledge base, we:
1. **Leverage existing user familiarity** with the IT KB structure
2. **Avoid content duplication** for overlapping topics
3. **Provide seamless user experience** regardless of entry point
4. **Maintain consistent quality** and style standards
5. **Enable efficient maintenance** through shared governance

The recommended unified approach with clear navigation sections provides the best user experience while maintaining the strengths of both knowledge bases.
