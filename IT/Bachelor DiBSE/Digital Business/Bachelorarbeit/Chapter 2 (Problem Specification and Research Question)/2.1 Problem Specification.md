Despite Spot's remarkably advanced capabilities, it's interaction with humans remains primarily functional. As Spot was designed for industrial use, the engaging qualities expected from a so-called "social robot" were not within the scope of it's creators at Boston Dynamics.

However, as Spot's design was heavily influenced by canines, there is an opportunity to incorporate the distinctive behaviors of its biological muse. In a later chapter, the unique bond between humans and dogs will be explored, providing insights to inform the subsequent programming and design necessary to enhance interaction between humans and canine-like robots such as Spot.
