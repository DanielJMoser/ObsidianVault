In an era characterised by rapid technological progress, the importance of user-centric and appealing design cannot be understated. This necessity encompasses both hardware and software, where usability and aesthetic appeal of a product play decisive roles in determining itâ€™s market acceptance. While this principle has been well-established in consumer electronics such as home computers or smartphones, its importance is often overlooked in the field of robotics.

As robots are no longer confined to research labs and industrial halls but rather become increasingly integrated into various aspects of daily life, their design must prioritise not only function, but also how their physical and behavioural appeal affect the humans around them.
