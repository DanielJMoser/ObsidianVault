# It Doesn’t Byte: 
## Unleashing Spot’s Potential in 
## Human-Robot-Interaction
---
## Initial Objective
- Investigate how **dog-like behavior** in body language can improve HRI
- Focus on Boston Dynamics’ **Spot** robot
- Development of mobile application **Dogify**

---
## Impediment
#### Restrictions imposed by Spot SDK:
- Believable recreation of poses -> **fine-grained** control necessary!
- No way to control **individual joints** via Spot SDK
- Possible solution: **Joint API** (Beta)

---
## New Focus
- **Literature-based** thesis
- Extensive **literature review** -> a viable endeavor?
- **Common traits** in successful dog-like social robots
- Which ones could be applied with Spot?

---
## Literature Review
#### Studies on Spot and HRI
- Research 
- Current behavior: **Uncanny Valley-Effect!**
- "Markers of control" -> Leash!
- The majority of studies (though not all!) suggest a **limited potential** of HRI.

## Literature Review
- 





---
## Summary
- User comfort **can** be enhanced through familiar, animal-like gestures.
- Spot SDK limitations **restrict** natural dog-like behavior.
- Future possibilities: Special licenses: **Joint API** for more detailed control.
