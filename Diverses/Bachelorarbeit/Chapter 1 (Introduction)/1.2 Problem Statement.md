Boston Dynamics’ Spot robot exemplifies a zoomorphic design inspired by canine forms. While Spot's primary function is industrial, the robot’s design inherently invites consideration of how integrating more canine-like behaviors could enhance its interaction with humans. Given that dogs have been human companions for thousands of years, their body language and behaviors are deeply ingrained in human psychology as friendly and approachable.

This thesis aims to explore the challenges and benefits of designing robots to mimic animal behavior, focusing specifically on canine gestures. By analyzing typical "dog-like" traits and investigating the technical aspects of programming Spot to exhibit these behaviors, the research seeks to demonstrate how integrating natural behaviors can create a more engaging and familiar experience for users.
