The presence of a friendly dog can have an array of positive influence on humans, including the reduction of stress and anxiety (Thayer et. al.). Interaction with a dog can further help in children's development of empathy (Giraudet et. al.). Interaction with pets can reduce cortisol levels and blood pressure, as well as significantly increasing the likelihood of survival after a heart attack (Bhatika et. al.). Gandenberger et. al. identified similar effects during canine-assisted interventions specifically.
