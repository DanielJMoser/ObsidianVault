The following section examines the status quo of etho-robotics, a field that laverages  models of human-animal interaction to design social robots, particularly focusing dog-like behavior.

One of etho-robotics principles posits that a robot's appearance should neither mimic a human nor an animal, but rather reflect the machine's function within it's environment (eg. Korondi et.al., Lakatos). From a communication perspective, however, inspiration can and should be drawn from animal-human interaction.

For example, Gabriella Lakatos found that implementing appropriately and contextually selected aspects of human-dog interaction can provide a believable and simple interface for humans. Furthermore, Lakatos examined the interactions between dogs and robots featuring dog-like behavior, identifying a potential working relationship, such as the care of the elderly (Lakatos). Participants of the study attributed emotional states of some form to the machine, a phenomenon supported by studies such as those by GÃ¡ci et al., owing to these implemented aspects of human-dog interaction.

Extending this research, Niitsuma et. al. focused especially on the aspect of "playing with the owner" in their proposed robot behavior model inspired by human-dog relationships. The study aimed to improve mutual interaction and attachment behaviors between the robot and a person.
The findings indicated that such integrations not only facilitated improved understanding and reduced anxiety but also fostered a stronger and more meaningful interaction between robots and their owner.

Integrating these principles with previously discussed findings, it's evident that perceived control, familiarity and natural-like interactions are pivotal in creating a pleasant climate of low anxiety and high comfort during human-robot encounters. Etho-robotics leverages these insights, while eliminating potential triggers such as the "uncanny valley"-effect, and avoids superelevated expectations of a robot's capability by backing a context-sensitive exterior.
