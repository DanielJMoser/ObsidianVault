The following section explores the status quo of etho-robotics, a field leveraging models of human-animal interaction to design social robots,  in connection with dog-like behavior.

One of etho-robotics principles states that a robot's appearance should neither be modeled after a human nor an animal, but rather express the machine's function in the environment it "lives" in (eg. Korondi et.al., Lakatos). From a communication perspective however, inspiration can and should be drawn from animal-human interaction.

For example, Gabriella Lakatos found that implementing appropriately and context-dependingly selected aspects of human-dog interaction can provide for a believable and simple interface for humans. Further, Lakatos examined the interaction between dogs and robots, identifying a potential working relationship in e.g. the care of the elderly (Lakatos). The participants of the study ascribed emotional states of some form to the machine, attributed to these implemented aspects of human-dog interaction, which was supported by studies such as by GÃ¡ci et. al.
