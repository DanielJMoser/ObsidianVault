As robots become increasingly present in our daily lives, the prospect of these machines becoming ubiquitous appears gradually more plausible. Not only is effective and intuitive Human-Robot Communication (HRC)  imperative, but in the instance of social robots, establishing an emotional connection between humans and machines can be extremely beneficial to HRI or even the robot's raison d'Ãªtre.

Although researchers have pursued humanoid design with great interest over the past decades, the complexities of human interaction pose a significant challenge in replicating human-to-human interactions in robots. An imperfect result could lead to the opposite of the desired effect, leading not to natural and intuitive interactions, but rather a feeling of unease in the presence of a humanoid robot. This phenomenon, known as the "uncanny valley"-effect, was suggested by Masahiro Mori in the 1970s . (Lakatos)

To overcome these challenges, an alternative source of inspiration could be considered: The deep and personal relationship people develop with their pets. Compared to interpersonal communication, there are fewer and simpler variables to consider in interrelationship between humans and animals (Konok, Korondi). Due to their relatively advanced social and communicative capabilities, along with their scientifically well-understood behavior, drawing inspiration from specifically Human-Dog Interaction in the development of robots has been proposed before in multiple instances (Konok). 

## Human-Centered Design for Robots in Public Places.

The integration of robots in public spaces however demands more than solely the technical ability to assist e.g. a visual impaired person in their daily life. Considering the comfort and perception of safety of our fellow human beings who may be incidentally confronted with a robot, be it in the halls of a university or a city's pedestrian precinct is equally important. Recent studies offer critical insight in these encounters, particularly with the nimble and versatile quadrupled robots. As the violent images of cinematographic tech-dystopias such as "Terminator" and "Black Mirror" are rather prevalent in the populace's minds, an autonomous robot on park patrol might be perceived as hostile and a potentially armed thread, instead of a security measure for the protection of the general public. (e.g. Jaung, Hashimoto et. al) The following section concerns with the examination of what may help levitating these concerns and the widespread feeling of uneasiness in the presence of autonomous robots. 

In the line with this, a study by Gupta et. al. investigated stress responses in humans during encounters with robot-dogs, reporting higher levels of stress in participants if a robot was navigating a predetermined route, than when it was actively looking for something. These comparatively lower levels of anxiety during "search mode" were attributed to the prolonged interaction time between the human and the dog and the associated increased familiarity. To a statistically less significant extend, the researchers reported diminished  levels of comfort when multiple robots were navigating the room as opposed to just one. No significant changes in stress were identified when participants were seated in the testing area alone or together. In contrast, Hauser et al. identified that the presence of another human in the role of an "owner" had a positive influence on bystanders, further reinforcing the importance of perceived control and purpose. A visual indicator of control and perceived purpose, such as a leash, often positively influenced human perception, leading to a greater sense of ease (Hauser et. al.).

## Children and Robots

In a study examining the implementation of robot dogs in preschool classes to enhance emotional literacy, Heljakka et al. found that these toy-like machines positively affected the participating children. It is widely acknowledged that a robot's appearance influences a user's expectations of its capabilities and behaviour. The toy's close resemblance to real dogs facilitated the development of a relationship with the robot dog, an effect that was further enhanced by the appropriate natural user interface (NUI). Although the children demonstrated a clear preference for interaction with the living dog, they engaged with the robot at comparable rates. (Heljakka et al.) Comparative studies (Barber et al., Melson et al.) corroborate these findings. An examination of children's perceptions of AIBO, a robot dog manufactured by Sony, concluded that over 60% of children attributed mental states, sociality and morality to the toy, indicating significant anthropomorphism. (Melson et al.)

A related experiment by Voysey et al. explored the impact of animal-like affective non-verbal behaviour (AANB) on children's perception of zoomorphic robots. The research findings indicate that children ascribed a higher level of mental abilities, such as perception or emotion, to robots displaying AANB. The presence of AANB significantly increased the perceived inanimacy and social attributes of the robot, which in turn might correlate with a higher rate of acceptance and a lower level of cruelty against them. (Voysey)

These findings indicate the potential of robotic pets to elicit similar emotional and social responses in children as their living counterparts. This suggests that children may be developing a new ontological category that blurs the line between animate and inanimate objects. The findings of the literature review permit a clear recommendation in favour of the development of robotic pets for children and young people.

Other research, however, which is not focused on children specifically, argues against the resemblance of robots to living beings, such as humans or animals, due to the same reason of perceived emotional intelligence and the consequently potentially inflated expectations towards a robot's abilities. Instead, robots should be clearly identifiable as such, although they may draw inspiration for communication from the realms of biology. This concept is particularly prevalent within the field of ethorobotics, and it is unlikely to be at odds with the conclusions of Heljakka et al., who have highlighted the divergence in attitudes towards robots between children and adults. We will take a look at Etho-Robotics in a later chapter.
