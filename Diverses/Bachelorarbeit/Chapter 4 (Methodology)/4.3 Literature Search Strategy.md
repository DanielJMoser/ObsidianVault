A systematic search strategy was applied to ensure the identification, selection and inclusion of relevant literature that address the integration of canine behaviour into robotic design, particularly in the context of human-robot interaction (HRI).

### Databases Used

Several reputable databases were utilised to ensure a comprehensive review of existing literature, chosen for their considerable collections of peer-reviewed articles and relevance to the fields of robotics, psychology and human-computer interaction. These include:

- ScienceDirect
- Google Scholar
- PubMed

### Keywords and Search Terms

Derived from the research question, a list of keywords and related terms was developed in guidance of the literature search. 

- **Human-Robot Interaction**: "HRI," "human-robot communication," "human-robot collaboration"
- **Zoomorphic Robots**: "animal-like robots," "biomimetic robots," "robotic pets"
- **Canine Behavior**: "dog behavior," "canine gestures,", "canid gestures", "dog-like traits"
- **Spot Robot**: "Boston Dynamics Spot," "Spot robot behavior," "Spot programming"
