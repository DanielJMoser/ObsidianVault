To simplify interaction with Spot, a key objective of this thesis is to develop a mobile application, allowing users to communicate with the robot via an intuitive interface, featuring a range of buttons that ultimately trigger canine-like behaviors. This involves addressing several key technical and design challenges, including:

- Ensuring stable connectivity and compatibility with Spotâ€™s Wi-Fi network.
- Integrating a sturdy Python back-end with a JavaScript front-end, utilising Boston Dynamics' Spot Framework.
- Designing an intuitive user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) that allows users to effectively command Spot regardless of their technical background.
- Enhancing user experience through real-time visual or auditory feedback.
- Implementing safety measures to prevent potential damage to the robot or the environment.
