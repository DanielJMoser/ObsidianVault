Verse 1:

Spiral path, propulsion
Vessel roars, tale unknown
Intrusive light, eclipsing real
Oblivion, my dance


Chorus:

Currents blur, perception lost
Transient quest, reflection consumed
Guided astray, illusions grasp
Bound to decay, dismay


Verse 2:

Marks fade, scene shifts
New worlds materialize
Bends shed skin, chimera gone
Unraveling self, where ends start


Chorus:

Currents blur, perception lost
Transient quest, reflection consumed
Guided astray, illusions grasp
Bound to decay, dismay


Bridge:

Hearts entwined, beneath the veil
Odyssey's course, no claim
Kingdoms rise, from ashes formed
Cyclic plight, purpose frayed


Chorus:

Currents blur, perception lost
Transient quest, reflection consumed
Guided astray, illusions grasp
Bound to decay, dismay


Outro:

Restless pursuit, I reclaim
Breath of life, untamed depth
Nomadic chant, transcends souls
Chaos within, elusive hold
