Verse 1:

A spiral path, propelled and wrung
My vessel roars, its tale, unsung
Intrusive light, eclipsing truth
Oblivion, a dance I choose
Whispers of fate, suspended in air
Guiding us through, our journey's lair


Chorus:

Engulfed in currents, blurred perception
In transient quest, consuming reflection
Illusory guide lures me astray
Bound to the wheel, decay and dismay


Verse 2:

Indefinite marks, the landscape sheds
As shifting worlds materialize ahead
Each bend, shedding chimeric skins
Unraveling self, where ends begin
Untethered roots, swaying, entwined
Lost in the rhythm, between space and time
  

Chorus:

Engulfed in currents, blurred perception
In transient quest, consuming reflection
Illusory guide lures me astray
Bound to the wheel, decay and dismay
  

Bridge:

Beneath the veil, our hearts entwine
On odyssey's course, neither yours nor mine
Emerging from the ashes, our kingdoms lay
This cyclic plight, our purpose we fray
  

Chorus:

Engulfed in currents, blurred perception
In transient quest, consuming reflection
Illusory guide lures me astray
Bound to the wheel, decay and dismay
  

Outro:

In restless pursuit, until I reclaim
The breath of life, profound and untamed
This nomadic chant, transcending souls
Within chaos, elusive control
