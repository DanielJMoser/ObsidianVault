Way over yonder is a place that I know
Where I can find shelter from hunger and cold  
And the sweet tasting good life is so easily found  
Way over yonder, that's where I'm bound

I know when I get there, the first thing I'll see  
Is the sun shining golden, shining right down on me  
Then trouble's gonna lose me, worry leave me behind  
And I'll stand up proudly in true peace of mind  
talking 'bout, talking 'bout

Way over yonder is a place I have seen  
It's a garden of wisdom from some long ago dream

Maybe tomorrow I'll find my way  
To the land where the honey runs in rivers each day  
And the sweet tasting good life is so easily found  
Way over yonder, that's where I'm bound  
Way over yonder, that's where I'm bound
