I was walking an inherent path %%inherited?%%
when I heared her voice again
so resolute, so out of tune
but yet so true to the heart

By the apple tree she sat, plucking strings
And when she saw me, she recalled
careless days, steering the maze
whatever tomorrow brings

**Chorus**

She was a pilgrim, sowing her seeds
And when she reaches King's garden
no sin's weight on her soul
she'll reap honey and green peas.

With angles and sparrows she'll fly
and she thought it to be true
gambling on the ancient lie
with stakes immesurably high

**Chorus**

Oh, little girlie, why won't you see?
Listen to my proposal
Of a new song, a better one
And there ain't nobody that can sing like me.

 There's nothing where light should be
But sticks laid onto you now, here
No masters, whatever their names
In your own little anarchy.
