Sie treffen sich nach Jahren wieder,
er hat sich sehr ver√§ndert, is a bissl a Trottl worden.
Aber er kann singen.

*Verse 1*
I lived in a place called [Okfuskee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okfuskee_County,_Oklahoma)
And I had a little girl in a [holler tree](https://genius.com/4102165/Billy-bragg-and-wilco-way-over-yonder-in-the-minor-key/Holler-tree)
I said, little girl, it's plain to see  
Ain't nobody that can sing like me  
Ain't nobody that can sing like me  
  
*Verse 2*
She said, "it's hard for me to see  
How one little boy got so ugly"  
Yes, my little girly, that might be  
But there ain't nobody that can sing like me  
Ain't nobody that can sing like me  
  
**Chorus**
Way over yonder in the minor key  
Way over yonder in the minor key  
There ain't nobody that can sing like me  

*Verse 3*
We walked down by the Buckeye Creek  
To see the frog eat the goggle-eye bee  
To hear that west wind whistle to the east  
There ain't nobody that can sing like me  
Ain't nobody that can sing like me  

*Verse 4*
Oh my little girly, will you let me see?  
Way over yonder where the wind blows free  
Nobody can see in our holler tree  
And there ain't nobody can sing like me  
Ain't nobody can sing like me  
  
**Chorus**
Way over yonder in the minor key  
Way over yonder in the minor key  
There ain't nobody that can sing like me  
  
*Verse 5* 
Her mama cut a switch from a cherry tree  
And laid it on to she and me  
It stung lots worse than a hive of bees  
But there ain't nobody that can sing like me  
Ain't nobody that can sing like me  

*Verse 6*
Now I have walked a long long ways  
And I still look back to my tanglewood days  
I've led lots of girls since then to stray  
Saying ain't nobody that can sing like me  
Ain't nobody that can sing like me  

**Chorus**
Way over yonder in the minor key  
Way over yonder in the minor key  
Ain't nobody that can sing like me  
  
**Chorus**
Way over yonder in the minor key  
Way over yonder in the minor key  
Ain't nobody that can sing like me  
Ain't nobody that can sing like me
