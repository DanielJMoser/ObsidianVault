Exhausted from this cosmic quest 
Wandering through uncharted lands
Their words, they echo - am I lost in space?
Inmidst lone darkness, 
Time seems to stands still
Listen, hear the galaxies whisper
They whisper of a test of will

Pre-Chorus:
A Cosmonaut,
Embracing frigid ignorance
An Astral Drifter,
Fragmenting all coherence

Verse 2: 
For eons I slumbered,
Slumbered in frozen dreams
Reality slips,
Slips from my grasp
This chaos surrounds me,
My senses are ablaze
Unsure of escape - or if I should strive

Chorus:
A Cosmonaut,
Embracing frigid ignorance
An Astral Drifter, 
Fragmenting all coherence
Celestial Voyager,
Embraced by chilling ignorance
Spaceman,
Dissolving all significance

Verse 3: 
Drifting through the endless void
Stars align, yet hope destroyed
Telling stories of their past, 
a distant trace
my heart's encased
Is there peace at last?

Chorus:
A Cosmonaut,
Embracing frigid ignorance
An Astral Drifter,
Fragmenting all coherence
Celestial Voyager,
Embraced by chilling ignorance
Spaceman,
Dissolving all significance

Outro: Spaceman,
Dissolving all significance
Celestial Voyager,
Embraced by chilling ignorance
An Astral Dritter,
Fragmenting all coherence 
A Cosmonaut, 
Embracing frigid ignorance
