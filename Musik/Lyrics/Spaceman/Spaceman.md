Verse 1:
T minus four, I'm headin' out the door
An astronaut, with fears I can't ignore
Driftin' far, can't find my way
These thoughts of unease, are here to stay

Chorus:
In this life we walk alone
An uncharted world we try to own
There's no signpost, nor compass hand
It's a feeling hard to understand

Verse 2:
T minus three, a land so strange to me
Out of bounds, where I don't wanna be
Odd customs, and unfamiliar ways
I'm just a stranger, in a bewildered haze

Chorus:
In this life we walk alone
An uncharted world we try to own
There's no signpost, nor compass hand
It's a feeling hard to understand

Bridge:
T minus two, I'm thinkin' bout my past
A life gone by, it all flew by so fast
Did I miss my chance, to make a stand
In these borrowed shoes, did I overextend

Chorus:
In this life we walk alone
An uncharted world we try to own
There's no signpost, nor compass hand
It's a feeling hard to understand

Outro:
T minus one, lookin' to the stars
Ponderin' life, and how we've come so far
If I could go back to the start
I'd live for love, and play my part

---

Intro:
T minus four, I'm stepping out this door
Embarking on a journey, like none before
Floating high, what guides my way
These feelings of doubt, they're here to stay

Chorus:
In this life where we roam
A vast, uncharted world that's unknown
There's no roadmap, no guiding light
It's a mystery we try to fight

Verse 2:
T minus three, in unfamiliar seas
Thrown off course, no path to set me free
Strange encounters and foreign rules
I'm lost and searching, feeling like a fool

Chorus:
In this life where we roam
A vast, uncharted world that's unknown
There's no roadmap, no guiding light
It's a mystery we try to fight

Bridge:
T minus two, reminiscing of my youth
A life that's gone, it vanished like a ghost
Have I missed my call to stake my claim?
In these borrowed boots, did I lose the game?

Chorus:
In this life where we roam
A vast, uncharted world that's unknown
There's no roadmap, no guiding light
It's a mystery we try to fight

Outro:
T minus one, gazing at the sky
Contemplating life, and questioning why
If only I could return to the very start

I'd live for love, and embrace my part
