As stated previously, Boston Dynamics' quadrupled robot Spot is an industrial robot intended to explore the complex environments of an industrial site or inspect high-radiation areas without risking human lives. Although it's impressive navigational abilities and dog-like appearance make civil use seem possible, Spot is not a social robot and likely unable to cope with the complexities of HRI in a way many use cases require.

While the viral promotional videos created by Boston Dynamics, which frequently show the robot dancing to pop music, undoubtedly helped popularise Spot in comparison to other robots, studies indicate that humans may still experience feelings of discomfort or even threat when presented with its presence. This phenomenon does not extend to robot dogs that are designed for use in therapeutic settings, however, as these are perceived as more welcoming. The aversion to Spot is attributed to two factors: its rugged, plastic exterior and its advanced autonomous navigational capabilities, which humans are not familiar with.
