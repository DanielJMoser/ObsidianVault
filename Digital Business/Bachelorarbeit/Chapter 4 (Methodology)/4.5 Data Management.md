The reference management software Citavi was applied to store and organise all reference and associated data. Due to the current lack of a dedicated client for Linux machines, the browser add-on "Citavi Picker" was employed in combination with "Citavi Web". References were sorted by topic and saved in dedicated directories, along with digital copies of the articles, if available. Due to the cloud-based nature of "Citavi Web", all resources were subject to backups and accessible across platforms.
