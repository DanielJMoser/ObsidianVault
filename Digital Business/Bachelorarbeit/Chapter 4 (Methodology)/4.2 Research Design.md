The large amount of existing literature on human-robot interaction and the emerging interest in zoomorphic robots permits an extensive literature review, which constitutes the basis for the development of the SpotMe app. 

Not only does this approach allow the identification of patterns, gaps and trends relevant to the integration of canine behaviour into robotic design, but it also aims to paint a picture of which behavioural patterns are likely to be simulated best and most effectively within Spot's mobility constraints. 

Further, it informs the design and functionality of the mobile application, ensuring alignment with established principles and findings in the literature, ultimately supporting the development of a theoretically grounded and practically viable application.
